# Empathic AI NPC Project (Dual Pipeline Architecture)

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI NPC system designed to provide deep empathy using **Carl Rogers' Reflective Listening** technique. The core architecture mimics human cognitive processes through a **Dual Pipeline System** consisting of a Fast Track (Reflexive) and a Slow Track (Rational).

This architecture allows the NPC to react immediately to the user's emotions while simultaneously processing a context-aware, intellectual response, solving the latency issue common in LLM-based interactions.

## System Architecture

The system operates on a client-server model using TCP sockets between Unity and Python.

### 1. Fast Track (Reflexive System)
* **Latency:** < 0.1s
* **Function:** Immediate emotional analysis and keyword extraction.
* **Model:** `DistilBERT` (fine-tuned on GoEmotions dataset) + `Spacy`.
* **Output:** Facial expressions, short interjections, and empathetic keyword mirroring.

### 2. Slow Track (Rational System)
* **Latency:** 1.0s ~ 3.0s
* **Function:** Context understanding and dialogue generation.
* **Model:** Google `Gemini 2.5 Flash` (via API).
* **Output:** Coherent, meaningful verbal responses that deepen the conversation.

## Tech Stack

* **Server (Brain):** Python 3.8+, Asyncio, Transformers, Spacy, Google Generative AI
* **Client (Body):** Unity 2021.3+, C# (TCP Network Stream)
* **Communication:** TCP/IP Socket (JSON Packet)

## Installation
