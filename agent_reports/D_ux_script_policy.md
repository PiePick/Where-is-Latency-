# Agent D — UX Script Policy v2

## Review
Current reactions are polite but often long/scripted for fast lane.

## v2 rules
- keep fast reaction short (2~8 words)
- neutral fallback on low/mixed confidence
- avoid over-interpretation in fast lane
- bridge fillers should be brief and sparse

## Good/Bad
- Good: "That sounds rough." / Bad: "That sounds incredibly unfair."
- Good: "Got it." / Bad: "I am following what you are saying."
- Good: "I hear you—" / Bad: long therapeutic monologue

## Actionables
- shorten all lists
- add neutral override rule
- add dedicated bridge list
- keep <10 words for fast output
